# isaac-save-viewer

This is the source code for the [Isaac Save Viewer](https://zamiell.github.io/isaac-save-viewer/), a tool to view save completion status for [_The Binding of Isaac: Repentance_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/).

- The save file format was reversed by [Blade](https://github.com/bladecoding) using [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/).
- It is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- It uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling.
- It uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for CSS.
- The achievement images are taken from the [Isaac wiki](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth_Wiki).
- The "items.json" file and collectible images are taken from the [Rebirth Item Tracker](https://github.com/Rchardon/RebirthItemTracker).
